It's interesting to note that Netflix has released almost twice as many movies as TV shows. Over a period of 67 years, Netflix has released a total of 3,735 movies and 1,955 TV shows(till 2022). It suggests that Netflix has placed a greater emphasis on producing and releasing movies compared to TV shows. This may be influenced by factors such as the availability of content and the preferences of Netflix's audience.

US, India and Canada are the countries that produce the most movies and shows.

As per the dataset, the highest release of Movies is in 2019 with 1424 of titles and 592 of TV shows in 2020. There is an increase in film released and it peaked in 2019, then it declined probably because of COVID 19.

Netflix has classified its titles into different age certifications. The majority of titles fall under TV-MA ratings followed by TV-14, indicating that Netflix's content is primarily targeted towards mature audiences above 17 years of age. Therefore, it can be inferred that the customer segment that is most suitable for Netflix's content is individuals who are 14 years and older.
